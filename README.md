# Decision-Tree
This is a project for one of my courses (Business Intelligence and Analytics). The dataset is about a set of cars with different features (e.g., number of doors, ...). Our goal is to predict the target class which shows the condition of the car. We will use different features to build different
decision trees. A training dataseT is used to build the model, while the test dataset is also provided to evaluate the accuracy of different models.
